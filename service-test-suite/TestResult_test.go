Scenario 1: Valid Test Request 

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when a valid TestReq is provided. The test will verify if the function correctly reads and parses the input, locks the TestStatusMap, retrieves the correct status and writes it to the http.ResponseWriter.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request. The http.Request should have a body that contains a valid TestReq. Also, setup a TestStatusMap with a known status for the given TestReq.
Act: Invoke the testResult function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the status written to the http.ResponseWriter matches the status in the TestStatusMap.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly reads and parses the input, retrieves the correct status and writes it to the http.ResponseWriter. This test is important as it verifies the normal operation of the function.

Scenario 2: Invalid Test Request 

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an invalid TestReq. The test will verify if the function sets the StatusCode to http.StatusBadRequest when an error occurs while reading and parsing the input.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request. The http.Request should have a body that contains an invalid TestReq.
Act: Invoke the testResult function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the StatusCode of the http.Request is set to http.StatusBadRequest.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an error while reading and parsing the input. This test is important as it verifies the error handling capabilities of the function.

Scenario 3: Test Request not Found in TestStatusMap

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a situation where the TestReq is not found in the TestStatusMap. The test will verify if the function sets the status to TestStatusNotFound when the TestReq is not found in the TestStatusMap.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request. The http.Request should have a body that contains a TestReq that is not found in the TestStatusMap.
Act: Invoke the testResult function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the status written to the http.ResponseWriter is TestStatusNotFound.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles a situation where the TestReq is not found in the TestStatusMap. This test is important as it verifies the error handling capabilities of the function.

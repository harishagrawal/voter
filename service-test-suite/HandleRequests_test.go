Scenario 1: Test handleRequests with valid endpoints
Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify that the handleRequests function correctly maps the "/tests/run" and "/tests/result" endpoints to their respective handler functions.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.HandleFunc and http.ListenAndServe functions.
    Act: Call the handleRequests function.
    Assert: Assert that http.HandleFunc was called twice with the correct arguments ("/tests/run", runTest) and ("/tests/result", testResult). Also, assert that http.ListenAndServe was called with ":5003" and nil as arguments.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly maps the endpoints to their respective handlers and listens on the correct port. This is crucial for the application's behavior as it ensures that the correct handler is called for each endpoint.

Scenario 2: Test handleRequests with ListenAndServe throwing an error
Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify that the handleRequests function correctly logs the error when http.ListenAndServe throws an error.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.HandleFunc and http.ListenAndServe functions. Make http.ListenAndServe return an error.
    Act: Call the handleRequests function.
    Assert: Assert that log.Fatal was called with the error returned by http.ListenAndServe as argument.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly logs any errors thrown by http.ListenAndServe. This is important for error handling in the application as it ensures that any server errors are properly logged.

Scenario 3: Test handleRequests with invalid endpoints
Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify that the handleRequests function does not map invalid endpoints.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.HandleFunc and http.ListenAndServe functions.
    Act: Call the handleRequests function.
    Assert: Assert that http.HandleFunc was not called with any other arguments apart from ("/tests/run", runTest) and ("/tests/result", testResult).
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function does not map any invalid endpoints. This is important for the security and integrity of the application as it ensures that only valid endpoints are mapped to their respective handlers.
